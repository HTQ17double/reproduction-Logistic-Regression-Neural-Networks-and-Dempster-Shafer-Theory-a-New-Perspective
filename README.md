# reproduction-Logistic-Regression-Neural-Networks-and-Dempster-Shafer-Theory-a-New-Perspective
This is the python code for experimental reproduction in the paper "Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Dempster-Shafer Theory: a New Perspective". I would like to express my high respect to Professor Thierry Den≈ìux for his thesis work.
The python version used in the demo: python3.8.1.
See requirements.txt for the python library used in the demo.
